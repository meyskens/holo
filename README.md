# HolosexualJS
Holo there, if you don't get these references: [GO. EDUCATE YOURSELF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxUnwCziDso)

Good now you know what a holo is and why you got attracted to it. As a holosexual programmer it is my dream to ever catch 
the shifting rainbows of unicorns and turn it into good looking and well tested code.

This repo contains my attempt(s) to recreate holo glitter in JS and CSS. It only works on mobile as it needs you accelometer to shift the colors as you rotate it just as you're secretly doing with your holo nailpolishes all day.

Suggestions, PRs and all other things (especially Menchie and Zyler hugs) are welcome!
